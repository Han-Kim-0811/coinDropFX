# coinDropFX 

coinDropFX is an academic project from Langara College CPSC 1181: Object-oriented Computing. It is currently being revised, since I gained more experience with object oriented programming. 

> **What does this project do?**
> - It simulates a game of coin drop.
>   - A coin will appear and drop beneath the button when a button is clicked.
>   - The dropped coin will either go to the left or right when it collides the triangular obstacle.
>   - 1 point will be rewarded per 1 coin when it drops in to the green zone.
